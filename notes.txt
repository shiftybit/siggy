import clr
clr.AddReference("System.Runtime.InteropServices")
import System.Runtime.InteropServices
WordCom = System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetActiveObject("Word.Application")
-- Struggles --
GetActiveObject works, however, I cannot do Wordcom.Documents.Open(ExampleFile) as open does not exist in this context (it did in the win32api)
System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetObject(ExampleFile) does not work, as this doesn't exist in that context either.

*Needed way to get the Active Directory User. Tim Golden's active_directory.py and the win32api were not going to easily work
*decided to use clr.
 clr.AddReference("System.DirectoryServices")
